# About this repository

This repository is reserved for the study of the content present in the course [Signal processing problems](https://www.udemy.com/course/signal-processing/) by Mike Cohen. 

The exercises in the course are in Matlab, so this repository translates the exercises to Jupyter Notebooks with my own notes for personal learning.
